![airbnb_newyork](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57ee73a-fc51-41b4-8e30-e7339fb3da19)


### Problem Statement

The New York City Airbnb market is vast and dynamic, with thousands of listings spread across various neighborhoods. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible insights into pricing trends, availability, and neighborhood popularity makes it challenging for hosts, guests, and policymakers to make informed decisions. 

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aims to address these challenges by leveraging the NYC Airbnb Open Data to uncover key market trends and patterns. By doing so, we seek to provide actionable insights that will help hosts optimize their listings and pricing strategies, assist guests in making informed booking choices, and inform policymakers in crafting effective regulations for short-term rentals.

### The purpose of this analysis is to:

‚úÖ Gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing, availability, and distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in New York City.

‚úÖ Explore trends in host activities, guest preferences, and seasonal variations to inform strategic decision-making.

‚úÖ Provide actionable insights for hosts to optimize their listings, assist potential guests in making informed booking decisions, and offer data-driven recommendations for policymakers to enhance regulations and support for short-term rentals.

### About the Data
üîπ Dataset Used: [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

üîπ This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

üîπ This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. 

üîπ This dataset contains 16 features/variables about Airbnb listings within New York City. 
Below are the features with their descriptions:

- id: Listing ID 
- name: Listing Title 
- host_id: ID of Host 
- host_name: Name of Host 
- neighbourhood_group: Neighbourhood group that contains listing 
- neighbourhood: Neighbourhood group that contains listing
- latitude: Latitude of listing 
- longitude: Longitude of listing 
- room_type: Type of the offered property 
- price: Price per night in USD 
- minimum_nights: Minimum number of nights required to book listing 
- number_of_reviews: Total number of reviews that listing has

### Guided questions for the analysis: 
- What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
- What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
- Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
