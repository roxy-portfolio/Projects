### Problem Statement

The New York City Airbnb market is vast and dynamic, with thousands of listings spread across various neighborhoods. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible insights into pricing trends, availability, and neighborhood popularity makes it challenging for hosts, guests, and policymakers to make informed decisions. 

This exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aims to address these challenges by leveraging the NYC Airbnb Open Data to uncover key market trends and patterns. By doing so, we seek to provide actionable insights that will help hosts optimize their listings and pricing strategies, assist guests in making informed booking choices, and inform policymakers in crafting effective regulations for short-term rentals.

### The purpose of this analysis is to:

‚úÖ Gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing, availability, and distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in New York City.

‚úÖ Explore trends in host activities, guest preferences, and seasonal variations to inform strategic decision-making.

‚úÖ Provide actionable insights for hosts to optimize their listings, assist potential guests in making informed booking decisions, and offer data-driven recommendations for policymakers to enhance regulations and support for short-term rentals.
