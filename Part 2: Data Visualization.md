# 👩🏻‍💻 Data Visualization with Tableau

- In this data visualization created using Tableau for the Bellabeat case study, we explore the relationship between lifestyle metrics and wellness outcomes. The visualizations reveal key insights into how variables like total steps and sleep duration interact, addressing our original question about their impact on overall wellness.

- Our target audience includes health and wellness professionals, marketing team, and stakeholders at Bellabeat. To effectively communicate with them, we have created clear, engaging visualizations that highlight the main insights and trends. By using Tableau's advanced visualization tools, we make complex data more accessible and understandable.

## 📚 Correlation Visualization 

#### 🏃🏻‍♀️ Total Minutes Asleep and Total Steps

- It shows a positive correlation between total minutes asleep and total steps, though the relationship is weak. 
- The R-squared value of 0.047 indicates that only about 4.7% of the variation in sleep duration can be explained by the number of steps taken.
- Additionally, the p-value of 0.307 suggests that this correlation is not statistically significant, meaning there is a high probability that the observed relationship is due to random chance rather than a meaningful connection.
- Overall, while there is a slight positive trend, the evidence does not strongly support a significant impact of step count on sleep duration.

#### 🏃🏻‍♀️ Burned Calories and Total Steps

- It shows a positive correlation between calories burned and total steps taken.
- The R-squared value of 0.192 indicates that approximately 19.2% of the variation in calories burned can be explained by the number of steps taken.
- The P-value of 0.010 suggests that this correlation is statistically significant, meaning there is a strong likelihood that the relationship observed is meaningful and not due to random chance.
- This indicates that as the number of steps increases, the calories burned also tend to increase, reflecting a meaningful connection between physical activity and energy expenditure.


#### 🏃🏻‍♀️ Activity Levels and Burned Calories

✏️ Calories vs. Sedentary Minutes
- The R-squared value of 0.684 indicates that about 68.4% of the variation in calories burned can be explained by the amount of sedentary time.
- The P-value of less than 0.0001 suggests this correlation is highly statistically significant, meaning it is very unlikely that the relationship observed is due to random chance.
- This indicates that as sedentary minutes increase, calories burned significantly decrease, underscoring the impact of physical inactivity on lower energy expenditure.

✏️ Calories vs. Fairly Active Minutes
- It shows a positive correlation between calories burned and fairly active minutes.
- The R-squared value of 0.2863 indicates that approximately 28.63% of the variation in calories burned can be explained by the amount of fairly active minutes.
- The p-value of 0.0016 suggests that this correlation is statistically significant, meaning there is a strong likelihood that the observed relationship is meaningful and not due to random chance.
- This indicates that as fairly active minutes increase, the calories burned also tend to increase, reflecting a significant connection between moderate physical activity and energy expenditure.

✏️ Calories vs. Lighty Active Minutes
- It indicates a positive correlation between calories burned and lightly active minutes.
- The R-squared value of 0.60636 suggests that approximately 60.64% of the variation in calories burned can be explained by the amount of lightly active minutes.
- The P-value of less than 0.0001 indicates that this correlation is highly statistically significant, meaning the observed relationship is very unlikely to be due to random chance.
- This strong positive correlation demonstrates that as lightly active minutes increase, calories burned also significantly increase, highlighting the impact of light physical activity on energy expenditure.

✏️ Calories vs. Very Active Minutes
-It shows a strong positive correlation between calories burned and very active minutes. 
- The R-squared value of 0.729807 indicates that approximately 72.98% of the variation in calories burned can be explained by the amount of very active minutes.
- The P-value of less than 0.0001 suggests that this correlation is highly statistically significant, meaning the relationship observed is very unlikely to be due to random chance.
- This strong positive correlation demonstrates that as very active minutes increase, calories burned also significantly increase, underscoring the substantial impact of high-intensity physical activity on energy expenditure.
