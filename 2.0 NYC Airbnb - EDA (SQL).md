I have initiated a new exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the NYC Airbnb Open Data, leveraging SQL for data manipulation and analysis. This project aims to uncover key insights about Airbnb listings in New York City, focusing on aspects such as pricing, availability, neighborhood trends, and host characteristics.

### The purpose of this analysis is to:

‚úÖ Gain a comprehensive understanding of the pricing, availability, and distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods in New York City.

‚úÖ Explore trends in host activities, guest preferences, and seasonal variations to inform strategic decision-making.

‚úÖ Provide actionable insights for hosts to optimize their listings, assist potential guests in making informed booking decisions, and offer data-driven recommendations for policymakers to enhance regulations and support for short-term rentals.

### About the Data
- Dataset Used: [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
- This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.
- This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions.

### Guided questions for the analysis: 
- What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
- What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
- Which hosts are the busiest and why?
- Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
